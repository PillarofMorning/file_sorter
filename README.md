# file_sorter
sorts files in a given path by the first word in their name then tags them with the date and time once moved. Meant to be combined with the right click functionality

I used this
https://github.com/seddie95/python_script_in_right_click_menu/blob/master/make_key.py

when you right click it will send the path of where you click as CWD
